Some notes on the useage of this program:

The program has some keyboard inputs that are not represented on the UI, these are:
-Arrow keys for panning the camera
-Right Shift and Right CTRL for zooming in and out respectively
-CTRL+C and CTRL+V for copy and paste respectively

The program handles saving differently if you are using either Safari or Firefox, where it asks you to input a name and downloads the file directly to your downloads folder
A regular directory select window of your Operatign System's choice is used for all other browsers

When using the custom polygon drawing functionality, the final color selection before you click the "End Polygon" button is used.
For example if you input 3 coordinates with Black selected, and switch to Red before you press the button, the polygon will be red.

If you wish to move polygons, select them first after clicking the "Select polygons" radio button, and then click the "Move shape" radio button. Now you can drag your polygons around the screen.
Deletion works one by one, that is, if you select the delete option, clicking on a polygon will delete it directly, regardless of it being selected.

Rotation and Move commands work on all selected polygons, you can select as many as you wish and they will have the same operation performed on all of them.

Selecting empty space clears all selections.

To use: Simply run the index.html file
